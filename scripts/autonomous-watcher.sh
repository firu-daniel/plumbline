#!/usr/bin/env bash
# autonomous-watcher.sh — the outer loop: a long-running local daemon that turns a
# file dropped in the inbox into an unattended engine run, tracks every run it
# started, and tells an operator when one ends.
#
# IT IS A THIN ADAPTER OVER THE ENGINE COMMANDS, AND NOTHING MORE. Each inbox
# filename pattern is bound to one (engine command, worktree strategy) pairing:
#
#   <branch>_task_prompt.md   -> /branch-start-plan-autonomous
#                                a fresh sibling working copy off the default
#                                branch (create-worktree.sh)
#   <branch>_review[_<n>].md  -> /branch-start-user-review-fix-autonomous
#                                the branch's existing working copy when it is
#                                still usable, else recreated for that branch
#   <branch>_docs.md          -> /branch-start-docs-autonomous
#                                a fresh working copy, as the task path; the
#                                dropped file IS the curated checklist
#
# The watcher knows only about inbox files, working copies, central logs, the run
# registry (including which engine each run was launched with), the concurrency
# cap, the kill switch, and exit notifications. IT CONTAINS NO PLANNING,
# IMPLEMENTATION OR FIX ORCHESTRATION LOGIC — all of that lives in the engine
# commands, which resolve their own anchors inside the working copy they run in.
# That is what keeps a future trigger (an issue label, a webhook) a drop-in
# adapter feeding the SAME engines rather than a second copy of the flow.
#
# WHAT THIS COPY IMPLEMENTS, AND WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT YET DO. The
# watcher is landing in slices. This one carries the anchors, the tunables, the
# registry, the kill switch, the vanished-process reconcile pass, `status`, the
# tick/watch loop the later passes hang off, the LAUNCH HALF — `spawn_engine`
# (one detached subshell running one headless engine session), `launch_run` (the
# bookkeeping around it, plus the live-log window) and `classify_run_exit` (the
# terminal-state decision that subshell ends with) — and THE INBOX PASS that
# feeds them: routing a dropped filename to its (engine, working-copy strategy)
# pairing, preparing that working copy, placing and committing the dropped
# artifact, archiving the inbox file, and launching the run. THE INBOX IS
# THEREFORE CONSUMED BY THIS COPY, which the slice before it deliberately did not
# do. It also carries THE TWO RESUME PASSES, the only ones that bring a run BACK:
# a `parked` run whose clarification answer has landed, and a `paused` run whose
# RESUME sentinel has landed. Both re-launch the SAME engine in the run's
# EXISTING working copy — they never create one — through `spawn_engine`'s 4th
# and 5th arguments, and they are what makes yielding a session cost nothing
# while a run waits. And it carries the last two passes: THE STALENESS WATCHDOG,
# described next, and THE USAGE GATE after it — which is what finally WRITES the
# hold marker every earlier pass already reads — plus THE MACHINE-LEVEL LANE that
# gate publishes into and every start consults, described below them.
# `classify_run_exit` is only ever called from inside the subshell `spawn_engine`
# spawns, which is the one place the engine's real exit code exists.
#
# THE STALENESS WATCHDOG HEALS WHAT THE RECONCILE PASS CANNOT SEE. That pass
# heals a run whose PROCESS IS ALREADY GONE. A run whose process is alive but
# whose session has stopped producing output is invisible to it: the record stays
# `running` for as long as the watcher does, holding a slot under the concurrency
# cap that nothing will ever free. The watchdog reads liveness from the newest
# mtime across the run's central log AND its raw `<log>.stream.jsonl` — the raw
# stream is appended on every event, so it is the more sensitive of the two — and
# acts in two tiers: warn once per silent episode, then kill the run's whole
# process tree, restore the last committed checkpoint and resume from the ledger.
#
#   * STALE MTIME ALONE NEVER KILLS. A single long dispatch that makes no tool
#     calls looks exactly like a hang from the outside, so the kill is gated on a
#     SECOND signal — the process tree's summed %CPU. Above the threshold the run
#     is busy rather than hung and the kill is deferred to a later pass. The
#     accepted trade-off is stated where the check is: a pathological
#     CPU-SPINNING hang is deferred indefinitely, which is far rarer than the
#     silent wait-forever hang this pass exists for.
#   * THE DESCENDANT SET IS CAPTURED BEFORE THE KILL. Signalling the registry's
#     pid ends the subshell but leaves the agent it was waiting on ORPHANED
#     rather than terminated (see spawn_engine, where that behaviour is recorded
#     as measured), and once the subshell is gone its children have reparented
#     and can no longer be enumerated through it. So the tree is collected while
#     the parent is still alive, the subshell is signalled FIRST — so it cannot
#     proceed into classify_run_exit and stamp a status this teardown did not
#     intend — and the pre-captured descendants are signalled after it.
#   * THE RESET-AND-RESUME IS SAFE BECAUSE OF THE FLOWS' COMMIT-PER-UNIT
#     INVARIANT: HEAD is always a valid checkpoint, so `git reset --hard HEAD`
#     discards only the dead dispatch's UNCOMMITTED work, which the resumed run
#     re-does from the committed ledger or checklist. Restarts are counted per
#     run and capped; past the cap, or with the working copy gone, the run is
#     marked `failed` with the reason in the notification instead of restarted.
#   * IT IS SKIPPED ENTIRELY WHILE A USAGE HOLD IS IN EFFECT, because the usage
#     machinery owns run state for as long as that marker is there.
#
# THE USAGE GATE ACTS ON THE ONE SIGNAL NO RUN CAN OBSERVE ABOUT ITSELF. The
# rate limits it exists for are ACCOUNT-GLOBAL, and they are reported as
# `rate_limit_event` records on a run's OWN headless stream — which that run
# cannot read, because it is the thing producing it. The watcher already tees
# every stream to `<log>.stream.jsonl`, so it is the only component positioned to
# see the account's state at all. It therefore makes ONE global decision from the
# newest events across every live run and applies it to ALL of them, through the
# ordinary pause protocol and nothing else:
#
#   * IT NEVER KILLS A RUN, and it never invents a mechanism. It drops
#     `<state_dir>/PAUSE` into each running working copy, tags the record
#     `paused_by=usage` and records `usage_resume_at`; the engine yields at its
#     next clean checkpoint, writes PAUSE_ACK, and classify_run_exit marks it
#     `paused` — the same path a hand-dropped PAUSE takes. Once the window has
#     reset the gate drops `<state_dir>/RESUME`, and the pause-resume pass above
#     re-launches the run with no further involvement from here.
#   * A RUN PAUSED BY HAND IS NEVER AUTO-RESUMED. The resume side acts on the
#     `paused_by=usage` tag alone, and a hand pause carries no tag.
#   * WHILE A PAUSE IS IN EFFECT THE HOLD MARKER IS UP, which is what defers a
#     fresh inbox drop (it stays in the inbox) and skips the watchdog above:
#     launching into a full window spends a run on an immediate refusal.
#   * THE WINDOW TYPES ARE ASSESSED INDEPENDENTLY — the 5-hour one and the
#     rolling weekly one — so a 5-hour window that has just reset cannot mask a
#     weekly window sitting at its cap. The worst state across every window of
#     every live run wins, and so does the LATEST BINDING reset among the windows
#     at it — the overage window's reset while `isUsingOverage`, the event's own
#     otherwise, because that is the one that has to pass before work resumes.
#
# THE GATE ABOVE IS PER REPOSITORY. THE LANE BELOW IS PER MACHINE. The gate
# assesses THIS repository's runs, pauses THIS repository's runs, and writes
# nothing outside this repository's state directory — but the window it is
# reasoning about belongs to the ACCOUNT, and two watchers on one machine would
# each reach their own conclusion about it separately: one pauses, the other
# keeps spending the shared window, the first wakes into a window that is still
# full and re-pauses. So every gate pass PUBLISHES its assessment — the same
# `<state> <resume_at>` pair it already computes — into one machine-level record,
# and the three passes that START work (a fresh inbox drop, a park resume, a
# pause resume) CONSULT that record before acting — and, only when
# USAGE_LANE_LOCK_ENABLED=1, also acquire a single machine-level lane. Both live
# under
#
#   ${XDG_STATE_HOME:-$HOME/.local/state}/autonomous-sdlc-harness/
#
# and lib/harness-run-lib.sh owns their format; docs/watcher.md states it.
#
#   * TWO KNOBS, AND NEITHER LIMIT IS DERIVABLE FROM THE OTHER. The published
#     assessment COORDINATES and is on by default (USAGE_LANE_STATE_ENABLED=1).
#     The advisory lock SERIALIZES which repository on this machine starts, is
#     opt-in and is OFF by default (USAGE_LANE_LOCK_ENABLED=0), so as shipped
#     several armed repositories run concurrently. MAX_PARALLEL_RUNS bounds HOW
#     MANY runs one repository has in flight. A repository holding the lane still
#     obeys its own cap; one that cannot take it starts nothing, however much of
#     its own capacity is free.
#   * WITH THE LOCK ENABLED, IT IS A PRECONDITION ON STARTING, NEVER A SECOND
#     PAUSE MECHANISM. Nothing here pauses, kills or re-tags a run because of the
#     lane: a watcher that cannot take it DEFERS exactly as it defers for its own
#     cap — the inbox file stays in the inbox, the registry record is untouched,
#     and the next pass asks again.
#   * WITH THE LOCK ENABLED, IT IS RELEASED THE MOMENT THIS REPOSITORY HAS
#     NOTHING LIVE, in `tick`, so a queued repository waits one poll interval
#     rather than for a whole run; and a watcher that died holding it loses it to
#     the library's stale-breaker — an owning pid that is gone AND a record past
#     the short ceiling, or any record past the long one. Never on a dead pid
#     alone: a one-shot `tick` starts a run that outlives it and exits, so its
#     pid is gone within the second while its run is still going.
#
# WHAT IT COMMITS, AND WHAT IT POINTEDLY DOES NOT. A dropped task prompt and a
# dropped docs checklist are copied into the run's working copy and COMMITTED
# there before the run starts, through the same commit wrapper every other
# unattended commit point calls: the engine's own "working tree clean"
# precondition has to be honest from its very first step, and a prompt left
# uncommitted is lost when the branch reaches a pull request. A dropped REVIEW
# file is placed and NEVER committed — the flow's own commits pick it up. Both
# commit paths are non-blocking: a failed commit or push is one WARNING line in
# the log and the run launches anyway, because that failure has to be visible and
# must never cost the run.
#
# THE AGENT BINARY IS REACHED THROUGH ONE VARIABLE, `${HARNESS_AGENT_CLI:-claude}`,
# resolved once below. It defaults to the real CLI, so an operator sees no
# difference. It exists so the launch and exit-classification paths can be
# exercised against a STUB that prints a canned `stream-json` transcript and
# exits with a chosen code: every other route into them is a real multi-hour
# session, which is exactly how a classifier ships untested. It is a deliberate
# test seam, and the only one here. It is also THE ONE PLACE THE ENGINE BINARY IS
# CHOSEN, and deliberately the only one.
# Choosing a binary is not by itself an engine abstraction: the flags below, the
# settings-file format `--settings` names, the first-message command form and the
# `stream-json` event stream this script parses are engine-bound too, so pointing
# this variable at a different runtime does not make one work. ARCHITECTURE.md,
# sections "Where the engine is reached — the launch path" and "Where the engine
# is reached — assets and configuration", enumerate the full coupling surface.
#
# ANCHORS ARE DERIVED, NEVER REMEMBERED. The repository is resolved from this
# script's own location, and the MAIN checkout — the first working copy git lists
# — is the one that holds the inbox, the logs, the registry and the kill switch,
# so every run is tailable and stoppable from ONE place while executing in its own
# sibling working copy. Every run-artifact path under it comes from the configured
# `stateDir` through lib/harness-run-lib.sh; none of them is spelled here.
#
# IT REFUSES TO START ON A CONFIGURATION IT CANNOT READ. A watcher that guessed
# would watch a directory nobody drops files into, log where nobody tails, and
# honor a kill switch nobody can reach — silently, for as long as it runs. So an
# unreadable library, a location outside a repository, or a `harness.config.json`
# that is absent, unparseable, multi-document, missing `defaultBranch` or beyond
# the `jq` floor ends the process with ONE line on stderr and a non-zero status,
# before anything is created. Those lines go to stderr rather than to the watcher
# log, because the log's location is exactly what could not be resolved; the
# service manager's own capture is where they land.
#
# THE OPERATOR OVERRIDE CHANNEL, AND WHAT BELONGS IN IT.
#
#   ${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-$HOME/.config}/autonomous-sdlc-harness/watcher.env
#
# is sourced when it is a file, and its absence is a silent no-op. It exists so an
# operator can change a tunable WITHOUT editing a generated file — a repository-
# scoped tunable would be a `harness.config.json` key and there is none, and this
# location survives a `daemon install` that re-renders the service unit. Its scope
# is the tunables below and nothing else BY INTENT; the mechanism is assignment
# order, so a value resolved above this point is reachable from the file whether
# or not it is a tunable. It is sourced AFTER the anchors are resolved, so it
# cannot move the inbox, the logs or the kill switch.
#
#   * It is sourced under `set -a`, so ANYTHING SET THERE ALSO REACHES A CHILD
#     PROCESS — the notifier, and later the engine. No value from it is ever
#     echoed or logged.
#   * CREDENTIALS DO NOT BELONG HERE. The push target lives in the machine-local
#     `push.env` beside it, which autonomous-notify.sh resolves for itself.
#   * THE FILE WINS OVER AN INHERITED ENVIRONMENT VALUE, which is the opposite of
#     the credential file's rule. It is sourced BEFORE the `${VAR:-default}` lines
#     below, so its plain assignment overwrites what the environment carried in
#     and the defaulting line then keeps it. Stated because it is surprising:
#     `POLL_INTERVAL_SECS=7 autonomous-watcher.sh status` reports 99 when the file
#     says 99. To test a value ad hoc, edit or move the file.
#
# The resolved values are printed by `status`, one line, names and values only —
# so the channel is observable rather than merely documented.
#
# THE REGISTRY IS A CONTRACT, NOT AN IMPLEMENTATION DETAIL.
# `<state_dir>/autonomous_logs/registry.json` is a single JSON object shaped
# `{"runs": {"<branch>": {…}}}`, and the shipped commands read it in that shape
# (`.runs["<branch>"].status`) to report a branch's state. The `.runs` wrapper and
# the status vocabulary `running | parked | paused | completed | failed` are
# therefore fixed: renaming either breaks readers this script never sees.
#
# THE KILL SWITCH IS THE OPERATOR'S, AND THIS SCRIPT NEVER DELETES IT.
# `<state_dir>/AUTONOMOUS_STOP` in the main checkout stops the watcher from
# launching or resuming ANY run, and it is removed by hand — a watcher that
# cleared its own brake would restart the very runs it was told to stop. It is
# distinct from the per-run `<state_dir>/STOP` inside one working copy, which
# halts one run.
#
# WHO RUNS IT. The service manager (`daemon install` renders the unit), or a
# person by hand for a single `tick` or a `status`. NEVER a dispatched agent:
# its basename is on the script-allowlist guard's `DENY_SCRIPT_BASENAMES`, so
# that guard withholds the permit rather than granting one, and the generated
# permission profile emits no rule for it either — an agent that could start runs
# could start runs about itself.
#
# Subcommands:
#   autonomous-watcher.sh            # the watch loop (the default; the unit uses this)
#   autonomous-watcher.sh watch      # the same loop, named explicitly
#   autonomous-watcher.sh tick       # one pass, then exit — the dry-run/test entry
#   autonomous-watcher.sh status     # print the run registry and the tunables, then exit
#   autonomous-watcher.sh usage      # print the usage assessment and policy, then exit.
#                                    # A READER: it pauses nothing, resumes nothing
#                                    # and neither writes nor removes the hold marker
#
# Exit map a caller can switch on:
#
#   0  the subcommand ran (the watch loop only returns this way on a signal)
#   1  refused to start: the library, the repository or the configuration could
#      not be resolved. Nothing was created and no run was touched

# naming a toolchain: which toolchain a repository needs is its own
# configuration's business, not this script's. APPENDING IS WHAT MAKES THAT TRUE:
# prepending pushed `/usr/bin` ahead of a `$HOME`-rooted shims directory, so the
# system copy of a version-managed tool won. And on a unit with no environment
# key at all, the appended directories are still what resolves `jq`, a Homebrew
# toolchain and an agent CLI under `~/.local/bin`, none of which lives in
# `/usr/bin`, so each is still REACHED. What the bare shape gives up is
# PRECEDENCE against `/usr/bin`: a Homebrew copy of a tool `/usr/bin` also holds
# — `ruby`, `bundle`, `python3`, `curl`, `make`, `git` — used to win under the

# would emit nothing at all, every window of EVERY run would vanish with it, and
# the gate would read `unknown`: a state that pauses nothing, not on a weekly
# warning and not on a `rejected` five-hour window either. A typo in the WEEKLY
# knob would silently turn the WHOLE gate off. The override channel above is a
# hand-edited file, which is what makes `95%` a realistic input rather than a
# theoretical one, so the value is reduced to something `--argjson` can always
# parse before anything downstream depends on it.
#
# Surrounding whitespace is TRIMMED rather than rejected — `jq` accepts it, and a
# stray space in a hand-edited file is the operator's value, not a different one.
# What remains must be a fraction: digits with at most one dot, which accepts
# `0.95`, `1`, `1.0`, `.95` and `1.`, and rejects a lone dot and every character
# `jq` would choke on. Anything rejected falls back to the default and says so

#                       RECORD IS A DEFECT: it means the pair it names is still
#                       sitting unarchived at the top level, where the next
#                       launch reads it as an outstanding question and parks on
#                       a question that was already answered. It is NOT a defect
#                       on a `paused` record: the pause branch returns before the
#                       archival on purpose, because a pause mid park-resume left
#                       that answer unconsumed. The pause resume never writes
#                       this field — a pause is not an answer.
#   stall_warned        `1` while the staleness watchdog is in the warn tier for

#                       once per pass. Cleared the moment output resumes, which
#                       is what makes a LATER stall on the same run warn again,
#                       and cleared on a fresh launch and on a restart.
#   stall_restarts      how many times that watchdog has killed and restarted

#                       fresh launch and on a `completed` exit, so a reused
#                       branch key never starts partway to the cap.
#   stall_killing       `1` for the width of a watchdog teardown, and the reason
#                       classify_run_exit reads the registry at all: the subshell
#                       dying under the kill would otherwise fire a spurious
#                       `failed` over the status this pass sets. Cleared on every

#                       pause is never auto-resumed precisely because it has no

# One dropped file, end to end. Returns 0 when it CONSUMED the file (launched,
# failed or rejected it), 10 when it deferred it FOR CAPACITY — this repository's
# own concurrency cap, or the machine-level lane (its shared state, or another
# repository holding it) — and 11 when it deferred it because the kill switch or
# the usage hold is in force. `tick` distinguishes the three. A deferral of
# either kind leaves the file exactly where it was and writes no registry record.
#
# Pattern routing — (filename pattern -> engine, working-copy strategy):
#
#   ^(.+)_task_prompt\.md$       -> task        engine, a fresh working copy
#   ^(.+)_review(_[0-9]+)?\.md$  -> user_review engine, reuse-else-recreate
#   ^(.+)_docs\.md$              -> docs        engine, a fresh working copy
#
# The task-prompt pattern is tested FIRST (the more specific suffix), but the
# anchored SUFFIX regexes are mutually exclusive by construction: a filename
# cannot end in more than one of `_task_prompt.md` / `_review[_<n>].md` /
# `_docs.md`, so a branch whose own name contains `review` or `task_prompt`
# cannot be mis-routed — `foo_review_task_prompt.md` is the task engine on branch
# `foo_review`, and `foo_task_prompt_review.md` is the review engine on branch
# `foo_task_prompt`. POSIX leftmost-longest matching of the greedy `(.+)` derives
# the right branch from a round-suffixed name: `foo_review_2.md` -> branch `foo`
# (the `_2` is consumed by the optional `(_[0-9]+)?`), while
# `foo_review_2_review.md` -> branch `foo_review_2`. THE WATCHER DERIVES ONLY THE
# BRANCH, never the round: the engine resolves the latest round itself, inside
# the working copy, which is why nothing here has to remember one.
#
# A filename matching none of the three is logged and ARCHIVED rather than left
# where it is, so it is not re-logged on every pass for as long as the watcher
# runs.

#      the resumed engine emits a fresh one — without the downgrade the gate
#      re-pauses the very run it just resumed, on every resume, forever.
#   2. RESUME-TAG PRESERVATION. `paused_by=usage` and `usage_resume_at` are the
#      ONLY state the wall-clock resume reads, and they are written when the
#      PAUSE is REQUESTED — while the record is still `running` for however many
#      passes the engine takes to reach a clean boundary. So the stale-tag
#      cleanup must NOT clear them until the pause sentinels are gone, or the run
#      is stranded: paused, untagged, and never resumed by anything.
#
# The event shape this parses, and the parts of it that are NOT safe to assume:
#
#   {status, rateLimitType, resetsAt, isUsingOverage, overageStatus?,
#    overageResetsAt?, utilization?}
#
# `status` moves allowed -> allowed_warning -> rejected as a window fills, and
# `isUsingOverage` flips true once overage billing engages. `overageStatus` is
# ABSENT in the allowed_warning state — measured, not assumed — so `.status` and
# `.isUsingOverage` are the only keys ever triggered on. `rateLimitType` is
# `five_hour` or `seven_day` today, and an UNKNOWN type is passed through rather
# than dropped: a limit type this parser has never seen must still be able to
# pause a run.
#
# Like the passes above and unlike running_count, this is a PURE SIDE-EFFECT
# pass — nothing captures its stdout, so `log` is safe inside it.
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Echo one "<status> <isUsingOverage> <resetsAt> <overageResetsAt>" line per
# rate-limit WINDOW this run has seen, or nothing when the stream file or the
# events are unavailable. The LAST event of each window is what counts — the
# five_hour one, the seven_day one, and any other type, passed through unchanged.
# A seven_day `allowed_warning` below USAGE_SEVEN_DAY_PAUSE_PCT utilization is
# downgraded to `allowed` inside the jq program, because the weekly warning fires
# from about half the budget and must not drive a pause on its own.
#
# THE READ IS BOUNDED, AND THAT BOUND IS A RESOURCE DECISION RATHER THAN AN
# OPTIMIZATION: the raw stream grows for the entire life of a run — hours, and
# every event of it — and this function runs for every live run on every gate
# pass. Reading the whole file would make the cost of assessing grow with the
# length of the run it is assessing. The tail is far longer than any burst of
# rate-limit events, so the last event per window is always inside it. Never
# replace it with a whole-file read.
